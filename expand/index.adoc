You can expand the capacity or capabilities of your StorageGRID system without interrupting system operations.

Before expanding a grid node, you must confirm that no data repair jobs are active. If any repairs have failed, you must restart them and allow them to complete before performing the decommission or expansion procedure. Refer to link:../maintain/checking-data-repair-jobs.html[Check data repair jobs].

A StorageGRID expansion allows you to add:

* Storage volumes to Storage Nodes
* New grid nodes to an existing site
* An entire new site

The reason you are performing the expansion determines how many new nodes of each type you must add and the location of those new nodes. For example, there are different node requirements if you are performing an expansion to increase storage capacity, add metadata capacity, or add redundancy or new capabilities. 

Follow the steps for the type of expansion you're performing:
