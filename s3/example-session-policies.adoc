Use the following example to build a StorageGRID session policy.

== Example: Set up a session policy that allows object retrieval

In this example, the session's principal is only allowed to retrieve objects from bucket1. All other actions are implicitly denied, except for StorageGRID-specific actions, such as using the link:use-access-policies/#use-putoverwriteobject-permission[s3:PutOverwriteObject] permission. The session policy can be provided as a JSON file while calling the AssumeRole API.

  ]
