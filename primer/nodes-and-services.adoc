The basic building block of a StorageGRID system is the grid node. Nodes contain services, which are software modules that provide a set of capabilities to a grid node.

== Types of grid nodes

The StorageGRID system uses four types of grid nodes:

Admin Nodes:: Provide management services such as system configuration, monitoring, and logging. When you sign in to the Grid Manager, you are connecting to an Admin Node. Each grid must have one primary Admin Node and might have additional non-primary Admin Nodes for redundancy. You can connect to any Admin Node, and each Admin Node displays a similar view of the StorageGRID system. However, maintenance procedures must be performed using the primary Admin Node.
+
Admin Nodes can also be used to load balance S3 client traffic.
+
See link:what-admin-node-is.html[What is an Admin Node?]

Storage Nodes:: Manage and store object data and metadata. Each site in your StorageGRID system must have at least three Storage Nodes.
+
See link:what-storage-node-is.html[What is a Storage Node?]

Gateway Nodes (optional):: Provide a load-balancing interface that client applications can use to connect to StorageGRID. A load balancer seamlessly directs clients to an optimal Storage Node, so that the failure of nodes or even an entire site is transparent.
+
See link:what-gateway-node-is.html[What is a Gateway Node?]

== Hardware and software nodes
StorageGRID nodes can be deployed as StorageGRID appliance nodes or as software-based nodes.

=== StorageGRID appliance nodes

StorageGRID hardware appliances are specially designed for use in a StorageGRID system. Some appliances can be used as Storage Nodes. Other appliances can be used as Admin Nodes or Gateway Nodes. You can combine appliance nodes with software-based nodes or deploy fully engineered, all-appliance grids that have no dependencies on external hypervisors, storage, or compute hardware.

See the following to learn about the available appliances: 

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-appliances/[StorageGRID Appliance Documentation^]
* https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^] 

=== Software-based nodes

Software-based grid nodes can be deployed as VMware virtual machines or within container engines on a Linux host.

* Virtual machine (VM) in VMware vSphere: See link:../vmware/index.html[Install StorageGRID on VMware].

* Within a container engine on Red Hat Enterprise Linux: See link:../rhel/index.html[Install StorageGRID on Red Hat Enterprise Linux].

* Within a container engine on Ubuntu or Debian: See link:../ubuntu/index.html[Install StorageGRID on Ubuntu or Debian].

Use the https://imt.netapp.com/matrix/#welcome[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool (IMT)^] to determine the supported versions.

During initial installation of a new software-based Storage Node you can specify that it only be used to link:../primer/what-storage-node-is.html#types-of-storage-nodes[store metadata].
