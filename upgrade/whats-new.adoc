[.lead]
This release of StorageGRID introduces the following features and functional changes.

== Security

=== Security enhancement for encrypted passwords on disk

Improved password security, including a highly increased hash round count for SHA512 password hashes.

== S3 consistency

=== Quorum consistency for new 12.0 installations
When you configure strong-global consistency on a new 12.0 installation, QUORUM semantics are used.

If you upgrade from StorageGRID 11.9 to StorageGRID 12.0, upgraded grids will keep the existing EACH_QUORUM/LOCAL_QUORUM (EQ/LQ) semantics when you configure strong-global consistency.
