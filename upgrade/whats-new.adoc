[.lead]
This release of StorageGRID introduces the following features and functional changes.

== Node recovery from non-primary Admin Node
You can now link:../maintain/selecting-node-recovery-procedure.html[recover any node] except the primary Admin Node from a non-primary Admin Node.

== S3
=== Branch buckets
You can now link:../tenant/manage-branch-bucket-html[create branch buckets] for an S3 bucket. A branch bucket provides access to S3 bucket objects as they existed at a certain time.

=== Quorum consistency for new 12.0 installations
Fresh installations of StorageGRID 12.0 and later will default to using Quorum semantics when link:../s3/consistency.html[strong-global consistency] is set. The new behavior for strong-global consistency provides site failure tolerance for client requests when grids have three or more sites. The performance characteristics of Quorum semantics will differ depending on client application workload. If you need to revert to the previous behavior for strong-global consistency, follow https://kb.netapp.com/hybrid/StorageGRID/Object_Mgmt/Configuring_StorageGRID_quorum_semantics_for_strong-global_consistency[Configure StorageGRID Quorum semantics for strong-global consistency^] for instructions.

If you upgrade from StorageGRID 11.9 to StorageGRID 12.0, upgraded grids will keep the previous behavior for strong-global consistency.

== Tenant groups

=== AssumeRole
You can now configure a new S3 trust policy to support the link:../tenant/manage-groups.html#set-up-assumerole[AssumeRole API]. 

NOTE: The Account clone process can't clone S3 trust policy when you clone a tenant group from a StorageGRID 12.0 source to a StorageGRID 11.9 destination. The clone process fails with an `unrecognized attribute, "s3Trust" error` on the destination. To avoid this error, upgrade the destination to version 12.0 and retry the clone operation using the link:../tenant/grid-federation-account-clone.html[UI] or link:../tenant/grid-federation-clone-keys-with-api.html[API].
