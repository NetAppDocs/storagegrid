This release of StorageGRID introduces the following features and functional changes.

== Security

=== Security enhancement for encrypted passwords on disk
Improved password security, including a highly increased hash round count for SHA512 password hashes.

== S3 buckets

=== Branch buckets
You can now link:../tenant/manage-branch-bucket-html[create branch buckets] for an S3 bucket. A branch bucket provides access to S3 bucket objects as they existed at a certain time. A branch bucket isn't the same as a backup.
