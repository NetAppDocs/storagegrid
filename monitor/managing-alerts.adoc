The alert system provides an easy-to-use interface for detecting, evaluating, and resolving the issues that can occur during StorageGRID operation.


//
The alert system is designed to be your primary tool for monitoring any issues that might occur in your StorageGRID system. The alert system provides an easy-to-use interface for detecting, evaluating, and resolving issues.

Alerts are triggered at specific severity levels when alert rule conditions evaluate as true. When an alert is triggered, the following actions occur:

* An alert severity icon is shown on the dashboard in the Grid Manager, and the count of Current Alerts is incremented.
* The alert is shown on the *NODES* summary page and on the *NODES* > *_node_* > *Overview* tab.
* An email notification is sent, assuming you have configured an SMTP server and provided email addresses for the recipients.
* An Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) notification is sent, assuming you have configured the StorageGRID SNMP agent.
//

You can create custom alerts, edit or disable alerts, and manage alert notifications.
