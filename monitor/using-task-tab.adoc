The Tasks tab is shown for all nodes. You can use this tab to rename or reboot a node or to put an appliance node into maintenance mode. For Storage Nodes, you can set the storage state.

For the complete requirements and instructions for each option on this tab, see the following:

* link:../maintain/rename-grid-site-node-overview.html[Rename grid, sites, and nodes]

* link:../maintain/rebooting-grid-node-from-grid-manager.html[Reboot grid node]

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-appliances/commonhardware/placing-appliance-into-maintenance-mode.html[Place appliance into maintenance mode^]

* You verify or set the storage state of a Storage Node after you add direct-attached or SAN volumes to Storage Node, or after you recover a Storage Node. Those instructions are available in the topics that describe these tasks.
