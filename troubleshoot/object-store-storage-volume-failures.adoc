The underlying storage on a Storage Node is divided into object stores. Object stores are also known as storage volumes.

You can view object store information for each Storage Node. Select *NODES* > *_Storage Node_* > *Storage*.

Depending on the nature of the failure, faults with a storage volume might be reflected in link:../monitor/alerts-reference.html[storage volume alerts]. If a storage volume fails, you should repair the failed storage volume to restore the Storage Node to full functionality as soon as possible. If necessary, you can go to the *Configuration* tab and link:../maintain/checking-storage-state-after-recovering-storage-volumes.html[place the Storage Node in a read‚Äêonly state] so that the StorageGRID system can use it for data retrieval while you prepare for a full recovery of the server.
