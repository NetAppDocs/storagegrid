[.lead]
When the *Objects lost* alert is triggered, you must investigate immediately. Collect information about the affected objects and contact technical support.

.Before you begin
* You must be signed in to the Grid Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* You have link:../admin/admin-group-permissions.html[specific access permissions].
* You must have the `Passwords.txt` file.

.About this task
The *Objects lost* alert indicates that StorageGRID believes that there are no copies of an object in the grid. Data might have been permanently lost.

Investigate lost object alerts immediately. You might need to take action to prevent further data loss. In some cases, you might be able to restore a lost object if you take prompt action.

.Steps
. Select *NODES*.
. Select *_Storage Node_* > *Objects*.
. Review the number of Lost objects shown in the Object counts table.
+
This number indicates the total number of objects this grid node detects as missing from the entire StorageGRID system. The value is the sum of the Lost objects counters of the Data store component within the LDR and DDS services.

. From an Admin Node, link:../audit/accessing-audit-log-file.html[access the audit log] to determine the unique identifier (UUID) of the object that triggered the *Objects lost* alert:
 .. Log in to the grid node:
  ... Enter the following command: `ssh admin@grid_node_IP`
  ... Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
  ... Enter the following command to switch to root: `su -`
  ... Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from `$` to `#`.
 .. Change to the directory where the audit logs are located. Enter: `cd /var/local/log/`
 .. Use grep to extract the Object Lost (OLST) audit messages. Enter: `grep OLST audit_file_name`
 .. Note the UUID value included in the message.
