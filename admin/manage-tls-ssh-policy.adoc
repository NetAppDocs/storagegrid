[.lead]
The TLS and SSH policy determines which protocols and ciphers are used to establish secure TLS connections with client applications and secure SSH connections to internal StorageGRID services.

The security policy controls how TLS and SSH encrypt data in motion. In general, use the Modern compatibility (default) policy, unless your system needs to be Common Criteria-compliant or you need to use other ciphers.

NOTE: Some StorageGRID services have not been updated to use the ciphers in these policies.

.Before you begin

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* You have the link:admin-group-permissions.html[Root access permission].

[[select-a-security-policy]]
== Select a security policy

.Steps
. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *Security* > *Security settings*.
+ 
The *TLS and SSH policies* tab shows the available policies. The currently active policy is noted by a green check mark on the policy tile.

. Review the tabs to learn about the available policies.

[role="tabbed-block"]
====


.Modern compatibility (default)
--
Use the default policy if you need strong encryption and you don't have special requirements. This policy is compatible with most TLS and SSH clients. 
--

.Legacy compatibility
--
Use the Legacy compatibility policy if you need additional compatibility options for older clients. The additional options in this policy might make it less secure than the Modern compatibility policy.
--

.Common Criteria
--
Use the Common Criteria policy if you require Common Criteria certification.
--

.FIPS strict
--
Use the FIPS strict policy if you require Common Criteria certification and need to use the NetApp Cryptographic Security Module (NCSM) 3.0.8 or NetApp StorageGRID Kernel Crypto API 6.1.129-1-ntap1-amd64 module for external client connections to load balancer endpoints, Tenant Manager, and Grid Manager. Using this policy might reduce performance.

The NCSM 3.0.8 and NetApp StorageGRID Kernel Crypto API 6.1.129-1-ntap1-amd64 module are used in the following operations:

* NCSM
** TLS connections between the following services: ADC, AMS, CMN, DDS, LDR, SSM, NMS, mgmt-api, nginx, nginx-gw, and cache-svc
** TLS connections between clients and the nginx-gw service (load balancer endpoints)
** TLS connections between clients and the LDR service
** Object content encryption for SSE-S3, SSE-C, and the Stored object encryption setting
** SSH connections
* NetApp StorageGRID Kernel Crypto API module
+
The NetApp StorageGRID Kernel Crypto API module is present only on VM and StorageGRID appliance platforms.

** Entropy collection
** Node encryption

*Note*: After you select this policy, link:../maintain/rolling-reboot-procedure.html[perform a rolling reboot] for all nodes to activate the NCSM. Use *Maintenance* > *Rolling reboot* to initiate and monitor reboots.
--
.Custom
--
Create a custom policy if you need to apply your own ciphers.

Optionally, if your StorageGRID has FIPS 140 cryptography requirements, enable the FIPS mode feature to use the NCSM 3.0.8 and NetApp StorageGRID Kernel Crypto API 6.1.129-1-ntap1-amd64 module:

.. Set the `fipsMode` parameter to `true`.

.. When prompted, link:../maintain/rolling-reboot-procedure.htmllink:../maintain/rolling-reboot-procedure.html[perform a rolling reboot] for all nodes to activate the cryptography modules. Use *Maintenance* > *Rolling reboot* to initiate and monitor reboots.

.. Select *Support* > *Diagnostics* to view the active FIPS module versions.

. To see details about each policy's ciphers, protocols, and algorithms, select *View details*. 

. To change the current policy, select *Use policy*.
+
A green check mark appears next to *Current policy* on the policy tile.

== Create a custom security policy

You can create a custom policy if you need to apply your own ciphers.

.Steps

. From the tile of the policy that is the most similar to the custom policy you want to create, select *View details*.

. Select *Copy to clipboard*, and then select *Cancel*.
+
image::../media/securitysettings-custom-security-policy-copy.png[copying an existing policy to create a custom policy]

. From the *Custom policy* tile, select *Configure and use*.

. Paste the JSON you copied and make any changes required.

. Select *Use policy*.
+
A green check mark appears next to *Current policy* on the Custom policy tile.
. Optionally, select *Edit configuration* to make more changes to the new custom policy.

[[temporarily-revert-to-default-security-policy]]
== Temporarily revert to the default security policy

If you configured a custom security policy, you might not be able to sign in to the Grid Manager if the configured TLS policy is incompatible with the link:global-certificate-types.html[configured server certificate].

You can temporarily revert to the default security policy.

.Steps

. Log in to an Admin Node:
.. Enter the following command: `ssh admin@_Admin_Node_IP_`
.. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
.. Enter the following command to switch to root: `su -`
.. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
+
When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from `$` to `#`.

. Run the following command:
+
`restore-default-cipher-configurations`
. From a web browser, access the Grid Manager on the same Admin Node.
. Follow the steps in <<select-a-security-policy,Select a security policy>> to configure the policy again.
