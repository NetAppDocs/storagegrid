The Network Management System (NMS) service on Admin Nodes sends notifications to the mail server. You can view the status of the NMS service and the size of its notifications queue on the Interface Engine page.

To access the Interface Engine page, select *SUPPORT* > *Tools* > *Grid topology*. Then select *_site_* > *_Admin Node_* > *NMS* > *Interface Engine*.

The system sends notifications one after another in the order they're triggered.

If there is a problem, such as a network connection error, and the mail server is unavailable, the system retries sending a notification for 60 seconds. If the notification isn't sent after 60 seconds, the system drops the notification from the queue and attempts to send the next one.
