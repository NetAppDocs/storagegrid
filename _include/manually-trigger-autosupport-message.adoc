StorageGRID attempts to send an AutoSupport package to the NetApp Support Site. If the attempt is successful, the *Most Recent Result* and *Last Successful Time* values on the *Results* tab are updated. If there is a problem, the *Most Recent Result* value updates to "Failed," and StorageGRID doesn't try to send the AutoSupport package again.

. After 1 minute, refresh the AutoSupport page in your browser to access the most recent results.

. View the package in AIQ systems by searching for `USER_TRIGGERED_SUPPORT_BUNDLE`.

TIP: Additionally, you can link:../monitor/collecting-log-files-and-system-data.html[collect more extensive log files and system data] and send them to the NetApp Support Site.
