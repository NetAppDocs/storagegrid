.Before you begin
* You must be signed in to the Grid Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* You must have the Root access or Other grid configuration permission.

.About this task
Manually triggering an AutoSupport package is recommended over link:../admin/configure-autosupport-grid-manager.html[Weekly AutoSupport].

.Steps
. Select *SUPPORT* > *Tools* > *AutoSupport*.

. On the *Actions* tab, select *Send User-Triggered AutoSupport*.
+
StorageGRID attempts to send an AutoSupport package to the NetApp Support Site. If the attempt is successful, the *Most Recent Result* and *Last Successful Time* values on the *Results* tab are updated. If there is a problem, the *Most Recent Result* value updates to "Failed," and StorageGRID doesn't try to send the AutoSupport package again.

. Optionally, send application logs and Prometheus metrics you collect from the *SUPPORT* > *Logs* page to AutoSupport. Refer to link:../monitor/collecting-log-files-and-system-data.html[Collect log files and system data].

TIP: After sending a user-triggered AutoSupport package, refresh the AutoSupport page in your browser after 1 minute to access the most recent results.
