* *All*: All nodes receive object metadata immediately or the request will fail.
* *Strong-global*: Guarantees read-after-write consistency for all client requests across all sites. When Quorum semantics are configured, the following behaviors apply:
** Allows for site failure tolerance for client requests when grids have three or more sites. Two-site grids won't have site failure tolerance.
** The following S3 operations won't succeed with one site down:
*** DeleteBucketEncryption
*** PutBucketBranch
*** PutBucketEncryption
*** PutBucketVersioning
*** PutObjectLegalHold
*** PutObjectLockConfiguration
*** PutObjectRetention

* *Strong-site*: Object metadata is immediately distributed to other nodes at the site. Guarantees read-after-write consistency for all client requests within a site.
* *Read-after-new-write*: Provides read-after-write consistency for new objects and eventual consistency for object updates. Offers high availability and data protection guarantees. Recommended for most cases.
* *Available*: Provides eventual consistency for both new objects and object updates. For S3 buckets, use only as required (for example, for a bucket that contains log values that are rarely read, or for HEAD or GET operations on keys that don't exist). Not supported for S3 FabricPool buckets.
